Implementation Language:

We decided to use C/C++ for our Lexer. We are both veyr familiar with C, and the multitude of datastructures available in C++ will only help us. With C++, we also have access to the Boost libraries which includes a FSM API called MSM.

Lexer Location:

The Lexer for Friday night is located in /git-root/milestone1/lexer.cpp
