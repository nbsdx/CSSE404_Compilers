Tests beginning with 0 contain only integers, + and - operators.
The output format is for the final Lexer, though.

Tests beginning with 1 contain all possible reserved words and types, but no structure.

Tests beginning with 2 contain structured code that should compile and run.

Higher numbers should target edge cases and more complex code.

Ideally we will be able to adapt some of this test bed for later milestones by adjusting the .out suffix.
